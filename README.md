# Kaggle Competition – Learning Journal

This repository is a **personal learning log** for my participation in Kaggle competitions.

It contains notebooks, experiments, and model attempts created while my learning journey.
The goal is **progress, not answers**.

> This repo documents my journey — what I tried, what confused me, what partially worked, and what didn’t.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Practice working with real-world datasets
- Learn ML workflows by doing
- Track my thinking and iteration over time
- Build a habit of documenting experiments
- Look back later and see how I’ve improved

This is **not**:
- A solution repository
- A guide to winning the competition
- A source of final or optimal answers

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Common tools used during the learning process:

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- LightGBM / XGBoost / CatBoost
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
